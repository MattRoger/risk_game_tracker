## Motivation
Risk can be a long game, and it can be easy to forget who's turn it is. It can also be tedious to count your territories each turn. This app solves those problems. 

## Build Status
Complete and ready to seize new territories. 

## How to use?
* Choose your gamemode and set up the game.
