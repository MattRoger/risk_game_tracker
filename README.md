## Motivation
Risk can be a long game, and it can be easy to forget who's turn it is. It can also be tedious to count your territories each turn. This app solves those problems. 

## Build Status
Complete and ready to seize new territories. 

## How to use?
* Choose your gamemode and set up the game.![risk tour](https://github.com/MattRoger/screenshots/blob/master/riskgametracker/Risk%20Game%20Tracker_Intro.gif?raw=true)

* When you are finished, click play.
* When it is the players turn, there name will be highlighted.
* If an attacker seizes a territory, add one to their territory count and remove one from defenders size. ![turn guide](https://github.com/MattRoger/screenshots/blob/master/riskgametracker/turnguide.gif?raw=true)
